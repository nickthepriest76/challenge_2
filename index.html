            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> My name is nima; born in Aug 1976 in Iran-Tehran. My major is Electronics Engineering. I started to work as an electrical technician while I was a university student and then, after my graduation, was promoted to electrical project engineer. I moved to the united state in Oct 2013 and chose to work in the automation field, which made me go to school for two years. I found a job at GE water as an E&I field engineer, and as I got some skills as a PLC programmer, I started traveling around the USA. During the hard work, I passed EIT and, after four years, took the professional engineering exam at Electrical, Electronics, and computers and passed it at the first shot. Now I hold a PE license. I always dreamed of being a software developer but never had a chance, and I believe the opportunity I was waiting for its time has come. That's all I need is to study hard and be consistent, and never get disappointed. Other words,
                " Never Back Down"</p>
